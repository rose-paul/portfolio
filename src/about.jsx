            <article>
             I came into the tech realm as an engineer following my previous work teaching English at tech companies 
              in Moscow.  I do fullstack web development and enjoy all aspects, from page design to system design.
              My most recent endeavors have focused on engineering in JavaScript, React and AWS.

             I value teamwork, continual growth and purpose-driven work. I love tackling substantive, real-world problems 
             with simple, user-friendly solutions.

              Outside of programming, I love to travel. I was fortunate to explore
              a lot of places during my time in Moscow, both in the country and the
              surrounding region. This photo is from the Krasnodar region on top
              of the mountain Indyuk.
