        <article>
            I came into the tech realm as a developer following my previous
            work teaching English at tech companies in Moscow. I do fullstack
            web development using several technologies and enjoy all aspects.
            My core interest lies in frontend engineering using React, Redux
            and Javascript. My enthusiasm for this aspect is driven by 2
            things: the practicality of mapping the backend to a usable
            frontend and the challenge of optimizing this connection.
            Javascript and React are great means to this end, and I am always
            expanding my knowledge about them. Below you can find my projects
            and a list of the main technologies and languages I employ.

            Outside of programming, I love to travel. From 2015-2019 I lived
            in Moscow, Russia. I was fortunate to explore a lot of places
            during my time there, both in the country and the surrounding
            region. While I've been on several great trips over the past
            several years, the Kamchatka peninsula stands out the most.
            Snowmobiling through the most remote parts of Russia in -40
            degrees isn't a situation I imagined ever being in. The pictures
            above include some of that trip, among others.
